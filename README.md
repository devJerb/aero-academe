# Brief Description
An Aircraft Website that describes its functionality in flight situations wherein the maneuverability is discussed thoroughly; given are the simulations of such equipment in action.

# Creation
I've started to use the boilerplate creation through Bootstrap using the create-react-app requiring you to perform npx.

You're able to use npm start, test, run, and build

# Details
The curated packages fall under the node_modules just in case, though you can just do npm install and see the logs.
