    title2: 'Frise-Type Ailerons',
    description2: 'The leading edge of the up-going aileron protrudes below the lower surface of the wing, causing high drag. The leading edge of the down-going aileron remains shrouded and causes less drag.',

    title3: 'Couple Ailerons and Rudder',
    description3: 'This is accomplished with rudder-aileron interconnect springs, which help correct for aileron drag by automatically deflecting the rudder at the same time the ailerons are deflected.',
